<p>CARS supports four museum ships: USS Yorktown (CV-10), USS Laffey (DD-724), USS Clamagore (SS-343), and PBR-105. For Museum Ships Weekend 2021 we activated the Mk1 PBR-105, a boat at Patriots Point that was commanded by local Medal of Honor recipient James Elliot Williams, using the WA4USN call sign. We have since created a club to honor the boat, and got a call sign for it.</p>

<p>The USS Yorktown operates as WA4USN. The Laffey and Clamagore use variations on their active duty international call signs: USS Laffey NT4HI (NTHI), USS Clamagore NJ4DU (NJDU). The US Navy maintains the Yorktown in publication ACP-113 with its original call sign NWKJ. The Mk1 PBR-105 is WD4PBR.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Patriots Point was unable to continue maintaining the Clamagore, and she was sent to Norfolk for cleaning and sinking as a reef.</p>

<p>The three remaining ships are activated for <a href="http://www.nj2bb.org/">Museum Ships Weekend</a> in June.</p>

<p>QSL direct for all four ships to:<br> PO Box 70341<br> Charleston, SC 29415<br>Include SASE or two green stamps.<br>WA4USN is also on Logbook of the World.</p>

<p>What's it like to be the DX? Here's a clip from Museum Ships Weekend 2019, operating as USS Clamagore, NJ4DU:</p>
