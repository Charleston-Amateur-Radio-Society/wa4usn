<p><strong>Welcome to the Charleston Amateur Radio Society.<br />This club was established in 1971.&nbsp; For a detailed history select History from the menu above.</strong></p>

<p>CARS sponsors or maintains many of the 2m and 70cm repeaters in the Lowcountry. The repeaters are linked, providing wide coverage for users. For more information on the linked repeaters, see the <a href="https://www.wa4usn.org/CARS/repeaters/">Repeaters page</a>. CARS also supports three APRS digipeaters, including WA4USN-5 with RF-&gt;IS and IS-&gt;RF iGating on the USS Yorktown.</p>

<p>CARS has a club room on the USS Yorktown and an emergency trailer. Both have 2m/70cm FM, UHF DMR, and HF capability. Major events supported by these include Museum Ships Weekend and Field Day. Smaller events include public service events, hurricane expositions, Boy Scout tours, MARS Crossband tests, and ARES training.</p>

<p>If you are interested in visiting the club room on the Yorktown,<strong> please make arrangements with us before arriving at Patriots Point</strong>. The room is not always manned and the staff can not help you. We can add a unique experience to your visit if you call in advance: <a href="mailto:CARSinfo@wa4usn.org">CARSinfo@wa4usn.org</a>.</p>

<p>CARS has monthly meetings on the second Monday of every month. Meetings are usually held at 7pm at the Golden Corral near Tanger Outlets in North Charleston. Visitors are welcome and you are not required to buy a meal.</p>



<p><br>The Charleston Amateur Radio Society is affiliated with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arrl.org/">American Radio Relay League (ARRL)</a>, has about 170 members and is very active.&nbsp; The communication needs of numerous events are supported by the club.&nbsp; An example of this is the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bridgerun.com/">Cooper River Bridge Run &amp; Walk</a>.&nbsp; Of course, the club also participates in major ham radio events like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/pics_fd09.htm">Field Day</a>.</p>

<p><br>The club maintains several&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/repeaterf.htm">area voice repeaters</a>&nbsp;which are linked on a 24/7 basis and several digis for the support of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/aprsf.htm">APRS</a>&nbsp;in the area. Our main club station, WA4USN, is located on the aircraft carrier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriotspoint.org/exhibits/yorktown/">USS Yorktown</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.patriotspoint.org/">Patriots Point</a>. Also located at Patriots Point is the submarine, USS Clamagore, which has club station NJ4DU and the destroyer, USS Laffey, which has club station NT4HI.</p>

<p><br>As an ARRL afiliated club, we also sponsor the DuBose Middle School Amateur Radio Club (K4DMS) as an ARRL “Big Project” school. This initiative began in 2004, building upon the momentum gained subsequent to a successful ARISS contact from the school that was facilitated by club volunteers in March of 2004.</p>

<p><br>The club meets the second Monday of each month at a local restaurant. These meetings allow members to discuss club matters and to conduct club business while enjoying fellowship over a good meal. Our December meeting is the annual&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/pics_xmas08.htm">Christmas Party</a>. See the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/meet.htm">CARS Meeting</a>&nbsp;page for details.</p>

<p><br>The minutes of the monthly meetings are printed in our monthly newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/carrierf.htm">CARS Carrier</a>. You can obtain a copy of the latest newsletter&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/carrierf.htm">here</a>, or if you are a member of CARS, through email or a hard copy through regular mail.</p>

<p><br>Once a year CARS hosts a very successful&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/hamfestf.htm">hamfest</a>. There are several forums you can enjoy and there are great prizes to win. Of course, it's a good opportunity to buy and sell equipment or to have an eyeball QSO with fellow hams you met on the air. Out-of-towners come and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/images/hamfestmap.jpg">stay</a>&nbsp;for the weekend and enjoy the hamfest along with the sights of Charleston.</p>

<p><br>The club organizes licensing classes quite frequently. These classes help you pass the necessary&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wa4usn.org/exams.htm">exams</a>&nbsp;to become an amateur radio operator, or to upgrade to a higher license class. If you are interested in attending one of these classes,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:CARSinfo@wa4usn.org">E-mail CARS</a>&nbsp;and you will be contacted the next time there are enough potential students to have a class.</p>
